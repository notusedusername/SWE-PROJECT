# SWE-PROJECT


Project work of the course software engineering on the University of Debrecen.
This application is an OpenJFX game named Color War. There is a board with white, red and blue fields, and the goal is that, the players have to fill the white fields, to have a row (if you paint with blue), or a column (if you paint with red) filled with their own color.
The game make a local leaderboard in the user home, under the ColorWar directory. It uses xml extension, that contains all the winner's username, and counts their wins. In the game you can see the 5 most succesful players under the Winners menu entry and when a match is over.
